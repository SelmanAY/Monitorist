  "body": "# What is Monitorist\r\n\r\nA collector for Windows Performance Counters to send collected metrics to Graphite.\r\n\r\n# Why reinventing the wheel\r\n\r\nActually it is not reinventing the wheel. I examined most of the collectors sending metrics to [Graphite](http://graphite.wikidot.com/). Some of them are very hard to configure or some of them are collecting counters using the wrong way. So I ended up writing my own collector. \r\n\r\n# Cut the crap and show the thing (Installation)\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n\r\n### Graphite installation on Ubuntu 14.04 Server\r\n\r\nA video demonstration of installation will be here soon but for now you can use this [Installation Tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-graphite-on-an-ubuntu-14-04-server) which is the one i have used on my development environment.\r\n\r\n### Monitorist Installation\r\n\r\nA downloadable zip archive will be provided soon (preferably from a continuous integration provider) but for now you can build it from source all the plugins that will be dynamically loaded on runtime will be copied to the output folder. You can xcopy the output folder and use it in production. \r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n\r\n### collector.json\r\n### hosts.json\r\n### sender.json\r\n### templates.json\r\n### log4net.config\r\n\r\n## Thanks\r\nFor making me understand the nature and details of Performance Counters\r\n\r\nSebastian Krysmanski for his [post](https://manski.net/2013/11/windows-performance-counter-types/)\r\n\r\nJavier Canillas for his [codeplex project](http://perfmoncounterhelper.codeplex.com/)\r\n\r\nFor all the brain storming sessions about counters\r\n\r\n[Ahmet Serdar AY](https://tr.linkedin.com/in/ahmet-serdar-ay-073a133b/tr)\r\n\r\n[Faruk YEŞİL](https://tr.linkedin.com/in/faruk-yeşil-19964622/tr)\r\n\r\nFor all goodness and flavor she put in my life\r\n\r\n[Bağnur AY](https://tr.linkedin.com/in/bağnur-ay-2795783b)  \r\n\r\n## Future features\r\n* Self performance counters \r\n* Management Api (probably through REST service on hosted OWIN Environment)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
