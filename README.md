# What is Monitorist [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SelmanAY/Monitorist.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SelmanAY/Monitorist)

A collector for Windows Performance Counters to send collected metrics to Graphite.

# Why reinventing the wheel

Actually it is not reinventing the wheel. I examined most of the collectors sending metrics to [Graphite](http://graphite.wikidot.com/). Some of them are very hard to configure or some of them are collecting counters using the wrong way. So I ended up writing my own collector.
